        | <b>What information do we collect?</b><br><br>
        | All collected information is related to a specific function of a tool, service or product within our platform.

        .privacyPolicySubtext
          | <b><i>Profile and Account Information:</i></b> To identify you as a unique user of idea-hub.net, we collect personal data such as your name, e-mail address and password. This also allows other users to identify you and interact with you. In addition to this, you may choose to provide us with information about you relevant to other users. This includes a description of yourself including areas of expertise, interests, the company you own/work for, information about external websites or profiles, etc. This information is public, and it is meant to help you better connect with potential collaborators, investors, partners and so on.<br><br>
          | <b><i>Posted and Shared Content:</i></b> Our platform allows you to make posts or write comments over posted content. This content is, by design, public. Other users can see it, share it or comment it. Non-users may see your content and even share it in other platforms, but they cannot interact with it. Currently, published content may take the form of images or text. Videos or Gifs might be supported in the near future. All content you share is stored in our platform’s database and linked to your account and user profile.<br><br>
          | <b><i>Actions you take:</i></b> Besides posting and sharing content, you can “like” posts or comments from other users. You can also bookmark any content of your interest for future referencing, or you can report any inappropriate behavior from other members of the community. These actions are stored in our database so they are reflected on the appearance and behavior of our live platform. Unlike your posted content, other users cannot see your bookmarks or whom you have reported.<br><br>
          | <b><i>Other information:</i></b> Additional information relevant to us might be collected. This includes the content of messages sent through one of our contact forms, the timestamp of your posts and other user actions, or any suspicious activity connected to your account (failed logins, reports from other users, excessive use of bandwidth, etc.).
        | <br>
        | <b>How do we use your data?</b><br><br>
        | We use your information to provide you with our services which, as mentioned above, include the management of your user profile, your posts and user activity. We also use your data to improve our services. This data might take the form of direct feedback received from you, reactions to marketing campaigns, or the analysis of our user’s preferences and interests. We may use your e-mail address to communicate with you when necessary, to inform you about policy changes or changes in our services, or to report reactions to your posted content if you have allowed us to do so. We may also use your data to comply with our legal obligations, protect our intellectual property, and enforce our <a href="/about/service-terms">Terms of Service.</a><br><br>
        | <b>With whom do we share your data?</b><br><br>
        | The content you post on the social network is public in nature. That means anyone who access idea-hub.net can view it or even share it on external social media platforms. It also means that registered users can make comments on it, bookmark it, react to it, share it or report it. Your content might also be indexed by search engines and positioned in their search results for certain key-words. However, idea-hub.net, as an organization, does not actively share your data with third parties and neither do we intent to do so. We do not sell your personal data to data-collecting or marketing agencies. We may only share your personal data when legally required by a public authority. We do our best to protect your data by following best practices in data-protection and cyber-security measures.<br><br>
        | <b>What control do I have over my data?</b><br><br>
        | We do our best to provide you with full control over your data. You can edit and delete comments or posted content. You can also edit or completely remove any information you have added to your user profile after registration. You can change the name you display in our platform when meeting our requirements (you can do so every 60 days). You can choose whether receiving or not e-mail notifications for content recommendations or reactions to your posted content. You can ultimately remove all your personal information from our platform by deleting your account. We may keep a record of your name, user ID, and the reason why you decided to delete your account.
